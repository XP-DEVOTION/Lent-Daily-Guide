Day 19: Give Me This Water | Third Sunday of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
Jesus doesn’t wait for you at the mountaintop —
He meets you at the well.

Welcome to Day 19 of our Lent journey, the Third Sunday of Lent.
Today’s reflection brings us into one of the most tender encounters in the Gospel:
Jesus meeting a weary, wounded woman at a well —
not in her strength,
not in her holiness,
but in her thirst.

This spoken‑word devotional invites you to recognize your own wells —
the places where you feel empty, tired, or spiritually dry —
and to hear Jesus offer you the same gift He offered her:
living water that reaches the places nothing else can touch.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why Jesus meets us in our thirst, not our perfection

How He reveals wounds only to heal them

Why worldly wells never satisfy the soul

A prayer to receive the living water of Christ

A simple daily activity to pray, “Lord, give me this water”

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
