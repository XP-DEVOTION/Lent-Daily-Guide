Day 2: The Dust God Loves | Thursday After Ash Wednesday (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
“You are dust… and to dust you shall return.”  
Not as an insult — but as an invitation.
An invitation back to humility, intimacy, and the God who formed us with His own hands.

Welcome to Day 2 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection slows down the familiar words of Ash Wednesday and lets them breathe.
We remember that dust is not a sign of insignificance — it’s a sign of closeness.
A reminder that we are held, shaped, and sustained by a God who loves us deeply.

In this spoken‑word devotional, you’ll hear:

Why “dust” is a beginning, not a dismissal

How humility frees rather than shames

Why our limits are invitations to trust

A simple prayer to anchor your day

A grounding activity to help you breathe and remember: “I am held by God.”

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
