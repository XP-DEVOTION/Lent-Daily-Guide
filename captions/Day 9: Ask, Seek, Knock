Day 9: Ask, Seek, Knock | Thursday of the First Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
Jesus gives us three simple invitations —
Ask. Seek. Knock.  
Not as commands to perform,
but as movements of trust, desire, and hope.

Welcome to Day 9 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection explores the courage it takes to bring your real needs, real questions, and real longings before God — even when your voice trembles, even when your search feels uncertain, even when your knock is barely a tap.

This spoken‑word devotional gently reminds you that God is not measuring the strength of your effort…
He’s listening for the movement of your heart.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why asking, seeking, and knocking are acts of trust

How God responds with goodness, not reluctance

Why Lent invites you to bring your real desires into prayer

A prayer for courage, desire, and hope

A simple daily activity to ask God for one specific thing

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
