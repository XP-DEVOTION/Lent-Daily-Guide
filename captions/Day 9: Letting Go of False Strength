Day 9: Letting Go of False Strength | Thursday of the First Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
“My grace is sufficient for you.”
A whisper that dismantles the pressure to be strong all the time.

Welcome to Day 9 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection invites you into the quiet, courageous work of letting go —
letting go of the armor you’ve built,
letting go of the pressure to hold everything together,
letting go of the false strength that exhausts the soul.

This spoken‑word devotional gently reminds you that weakness is not failure —
it’s the doorway where grace enters.
God doesn’t ask you to be invincible.
He asks you to be open.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why weakness is not shame, but invitation

How false strength keeps us from receiving real strength

Why surrender is the beginning of healing

A prayer to let God carry what you can’t

A simple daily activity to name one place where you feel weak

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
