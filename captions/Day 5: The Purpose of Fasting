Day 5: The Purpose of Fasting | First Sunday of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
Fasting isn’t about deprivation —
it’s about making space for God.

Welcome to Day 5 of our Lent journey, the First Sunday of Lent.
Today’s reflection invites us to see fasting not as losing something,
but as opening our hands, our hearts, and our lives
to the God who longs to fill us with compassion, clarity, and freedom.

In this spoken‑word devotional, we explore the deeper meaning of fasting —
a practice that loosens the bonds of injustice,
awakens empathy,
and creates room for God’s love to move more freely within us.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why fasting is about freedom, not punishment

How letting go creates space for prayer, clarity, and compassion

Why true fasting always opens outward toward others

A prayer to purify your intentions

A simple daily activity to turn sacrifice into intercession

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
