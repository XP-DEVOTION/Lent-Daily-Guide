Day 3: Led Into the Desert | Friday After Ash Wednesday (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
The desert can feel like emptiness…
but in Scripture, the desert is where God prepares the heart.

Welcome to Day 3 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection enters the quiet, sacred space where Jesus Himself was led — not by accident, not by misfortune, but by the Spirit.

In this spoken‑word devotional, we explore the deeper meaning of the desert:
a place of honesty, clarity, and transformation.
A place where distractions fade and God becomes clearer.
A place where strength is discovered, trust is deepened, and mission is refined.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why the desert is preparation, not punishment

How God uses quiet seasons to strengthen and awaken the heart

What Jesus discovered in His own desert

A prayer for courage and openness

A simple daily practice to create a moment of holy silence

If this journey is blessing you, consider walking with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
