Day 7: Resting in God’s Mercy | Tuesday of the First Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
Mercy isn’t something you earn —
it’s something you rest in.

Welcome to Day 7 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection invites you to slow down and receive the truth of Psalm 103:
“The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.”

So many of us know how to strive, apologize, improve, and push ourselves…
but resting in mercy is harder.
This spoken‑word devotional gently guides you back to the God who sees you,
loves you,
holds you,
and delights in forgiving you.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why mercy is an invitation, not a reward

How God loves you in the places you feel least lovable

Why Lent is a season of remembering, not proving

A prayer to help you rest in God’s compassion

A simple daily activity to breathe in the word “Mercy”

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
