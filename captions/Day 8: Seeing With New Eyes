Day 8: Seeing With New Eyes | Wednesday of the First Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
Sometimes the deepest transformation begins with a simple prayer:
“Search me, O God… open my eyes.”

Welcome to Day 8 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection invites you into a different kind of seeing —
not with your eyes,
but with your heart.

Lent is a season of clarity, a time when God gently reveals what distracts, burdens, or dims your vision… not to shame you, but to free you. This spoken‑word devotional guides you into that gentle honesty — the kind that helps you see your life, your desires, and your heart as God sees them.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why spiritual clarity begins with vulnerability

How God reveals truth with gentleness, not judgment

Why Lent slows us down to notice what we often overlook

A prayer for open eyes and an open heart

A simple daily activity to name one distraction and begin releasing it

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
