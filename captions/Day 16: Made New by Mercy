📌 YouTube Title
Day 16: Made New by Mercy | Thursday of the Second Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
“Though your sins be like scarlet, they shall become white as snow.”
Not a threat.
Not a warning.
An invitation.

Welcome to Day 16 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection draws us into one of the most hopeful promises in Scripture —
God’s desire to cleanse, renew, and restore the places in us we’re most afraid to bring into the light.

This spoken‑word devotional gently reminds you that nothing in your life is beyond God’s mercy.
Not your past.
Not your patterns.
Not your wounds.
Not your weakness.
God doesn’t ask you to fix yourself first — He simply asks you to come.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why God’s mercy is an invitation, not a condemnation

How God meets you in your weakness without shock or disappointment

Why transformation begins with honesty, not effort

A prayer for cleansing, renewal, and healing

A simple daily activity to bring one area of your life into God’s light

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
