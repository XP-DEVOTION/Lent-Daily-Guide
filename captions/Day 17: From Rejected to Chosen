📌 YouTube Title
Day 17: From Rejected to Chosen | Friday of the Second Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
“The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.”
A reminder for every heart that has ever felt unseen, unwanted, or set aside.

Welcome to Day 17 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection speaks directly into the places where rejection has left a mark —
the moments that didn’t unfold the way you hoped,
the doors that didn’t open,
the relationships that didn’t last,
the dreams that felt like they slipped through your fingers.

This spoken‑word devotional reveals the deeper truth:
God builds differently.
God sees differently.
God chooses differently.
And the very places where you’ve felt rejected may be the places where God is preparing to build something strong, beautiful, and essential.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why rejection is not the end of your story

How God uses what the world overlooks

Why closed doors can be protection, not punishment

A prayer for trust, healing, and new beginnings

A simple daily activity to bring one moment of rejection into God’s light

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
