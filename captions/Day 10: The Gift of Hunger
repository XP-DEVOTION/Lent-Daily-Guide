Day 10: The Gift of Hunger | Friday of the First Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
Hunger isn’t a problem —
it’s a sign of life.

Welcome to Day 10 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection invites you to pay attention to the deeper hunger within you —
the longing beneath the surface,
the ache that rises in quiet moments,
the desire that nothing in this world seems to satisfy.

This spoken‑word devotional reminds you that spiritual hunger is holy.
It is God awakening desire,
God stirring your heart,
God drawing you deeper into His presence.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why spiritual hunger is a gift, not a burden

How longing becomes prayer during Lent

Why nothing earthly can satisfy the soul’s deepest thirst

A prayer to let your hunger lead you closer to God

A simple daily activity to pause before a meal and honor your spiritual hunger

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
