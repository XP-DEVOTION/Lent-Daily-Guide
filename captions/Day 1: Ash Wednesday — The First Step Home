📌 YouTube Description (Warm, Devotional, Human)
Peace be with you. Today is Day 1 — Ash Wednesday.  
This is the doorway into Lent, the beginning of a slow and gentle return to God.
Ash Wednesday doesn’t shout. It whispers. It invites. It reminds us that even in our dust, God leans close and says, “Return to Me with all your heart.”

In this 4–5 minute spoken‑word reflection, we pause…
we breathe…
and we let our hearts turn back toward the One who never stopped loving us.

This video includes:

A warm salutation

A full Ash Wednesday reflection

“So let us pray” + the official prayer

Today’s simple activity

A slow, contemplative pace to guide you into Lent

May this be the first step of a beautiful journey home.

🙏 Prayer:  
“Lord, I return to You with honesty and hope. Receive my heart and renew my desire for You. Amen.”

🕊️ Today’s Activity:  
Whisper at some point today: “Lord, I return to You.”

If this blessed you, follow along for all 40 days of Lent.
