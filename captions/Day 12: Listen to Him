Day 12: Listen to Him | Second Sunday of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
The mountain is where clarity comes —
where noise fades,
where Jesus shines,
and where the Father speaks.

Welcome to Day 12 of our Lent journey, the Second Sunday of Lent.
Today’s reflection takes us up the mountain of the Transfiguration —
a moment of radiant glory where Jesus is revealed not just as teacher or healer,
but as the beloved Son of God.

And from the cloud comes a simple, life‑changing invitation:
“Listen to Him.”

This spoken‑word devotional invites you into that same clarity —
to step away from the noise,
to rise above distraction,
and to hear the voice of God with fresh ears and an open heart.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why the Transfiguration reveals who Jesus truly is

How listening becomes the doorway to transformation

Why Lent invites you to climb the mountain of stillness

A prayer for open ears and a clear heart

A simple daily activity to spend five minutes in silence and listen

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
