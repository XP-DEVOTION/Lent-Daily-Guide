Day 21: Forgive Again | Tuesday of the Third Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
“How often must I forgive?”
It’s the question every heart asks —
and Jesus answers with mercy that has no limits.

Welcome to Day 21 of our Lent journey, the final day of this 21‑day stretch.
Today’s reflection brings us into the honest, vulnerable place where forgiveness becomes more than a moment — it becomes a way of living, a way of healing, a way of letting God free the heart from what has been weighing it down.

This spoken‑word devotional explores the courage it takes to forgive again and again —
not because the other person deserves it,
but because you deserve peace.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why forgiveness is a journey, not a single act

How Jesus invites us into mercy without limits

Why forgiveness frees your future more than it fixes your past

A prayer for courage, healing, and release

A simple daily activity to name one person or moment you need to forgive

Thank you for walking these 21 days of Lent with me.
If this reflection has blessed you, consider continuing the journey through all 40 days.

Peace be with you.
