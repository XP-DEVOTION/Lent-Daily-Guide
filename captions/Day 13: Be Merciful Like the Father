📌 YouTube Title
Day 13: Be Merciful Like the Father | Monday of the Second Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
“Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.”
A simple command — and a lifelong transformation.

Welcome to Day 13 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection invites you into the heart of God’s mercy —
a mercy that is patient, tender, compassionate, and endlessly faithful.
A mercy God pours over you again and again…
and a mercy He invites you to extend to others.

This spoken‑word devotional explores what it truly means to be merciful —
not by excusing hurt,
not by denying pain,
but by choosing compassion over resentment
and love over bitterness.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why mercy is the language of heaven

How God’s mercy toward you becomes your strength to show mercy to others

Why mercy heals rather than excuses

A prayer to make your heart more like the Father’s

A simple daily activity to offer one act of mercy today

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
