Day 11: Love Your Enemies | Saturday of the First Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
“Love your enemies.”
Few teachings of Jesus stretch the heart more —
and few transform it more deeply.

Welcome to Day 11 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection brings us into one of the most radical invitations of the Gospel:
to love, pray for, and release resentment toward those who have hurt us.
Not by pretending the pain didn’t happen,
not by excusing wrongdoing,
but by refusing to let bitterness take root.

This spoken‑word devotional gently guides you into the slow, courageous work of enemy‑love —
a love that is only possible through grace,
a love that frees your heart,
a love that makes you more like Christ.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why loving enemies is not approval, passivity, or forgetting

How Jesus invites you into divine, not easy, love

Why praying for those who hurt you brings healing to your own heart

A prayer for courage, mercy, and Christ‑like love

A simple daily activity to pray for one difficult person

If this reflection speaks to you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
