📌 YouTube Title
Day 18: The Father Who Runs | Saturday of the Second Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
“While he was still a long way off, his father saw him…”
Before the apology.
Before the explanation.
Before the son could fix anything.
The father ran.

Welcome to Day 18 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection brings us into one of the most tender and revealing images Jesus ever gave us —
a Father who watches the road,
a Father who notices the smallest turn of your heart,
a Father who runs toward you the moment you take a single step toward Him.

This spoken‑word devotional invites you to let go of fear, shame, and hesitation,
and to trust the God who restores not halfway,
but fully —
not reluctantly,
but joyfully.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why God runs toward you long before you reach Him

How the Father restores you as a child, not a servant

Why distance doesn’t discourage God — it moves Him

A prayer to return honestly and trust His embrace

A simple daily activity to take one small step toward home

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
