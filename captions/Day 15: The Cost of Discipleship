Day 15: The Cost of Discipleship | Wednesday of the Second Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
“The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve.”
These words redefine greatness — and reshape the heart of discipleship.

Welcome to Day 15 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection invites you into the humble, hidden, transformative path Jesus walked —
a path not of status or applause,
but of service, sacrifice, and quiet love.

This spoken‑word devotional explores the true cost of discipleship:
not money, not success, not recognition —
but the surrender of comfort, pride, and the need to be first.
It’s the cost that frees the heart,
the cost that makes us more like Christ.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why Jesus chose the towel instead of the throne

How discipleship is about becoming like Christ, not just believing in Him

Why service is the hidden place where we meet Jesus

A prayer for a servant’s heart

A simple daily activity to offer one hidden act of service

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
