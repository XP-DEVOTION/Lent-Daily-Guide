Day 6: The Quiet Work of Grace | Monday of the First Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
So much of God’s work in us is quiet —
hidden beneath the surface,
growing slowly, gently, faithfully.

Welcome to Day 6 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection invites us to trust the subtle, unseen work of grace —
the kind that forms roots before branches,
depth before height,
foundation before fruit.

In this spoken‑word devotional, we explore the mystery of God’s slow work:
the transformation that happens when we’re not looking,
the healing that unfolds in silence,
the growth that takes place in the soil of ordinary life.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why grace often works beneath the surface

How God forms roots before visible growth

Why transformation is usually slow, gentle, and hidden

A prayer for patience and trust

A simple daily activity to help you notice God in the ordinary

If this reflection speaks to you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
