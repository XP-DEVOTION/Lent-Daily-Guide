Day 20: The One Thing Needed | Monday of the Third Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
“There is need of only one thing.”
In a world of noise, pressure, and endless expectations, Jesus speaks a word that simplifies the soul.

Welcome to Day 20 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection brings us into the home of Martha and Mary —
one overwhelmed, one at rest —
and into the gentle invitation Jesus offers every restless heart:
to choose presence over pressure,
stillness over striving,
the essential over the endless.

This spoken‑word devotional invites you to let Jesus quiet your spirit,
to draw you back to what matters most,
and to rediscover the peace that comes from simply being with Him.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why Jesus calls us back to the “one thing”

How good things can distract us from the essential thing

Why presence matters more than productivity

A prayer to steady your heart in God’s presence

A simple daily activity to sit with Jesus in silence

If this reflection blesses you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
