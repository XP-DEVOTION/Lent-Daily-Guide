Day 4: The First Step of Conversion | Saturday After Ash Wednesday (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
Conversion rarely begins with a dramatic moment —
it begins with a quiet turning of the heart.

Welcome to Day 4 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection slows down Jesus’ invitation:
“Repent and believe in the Gospel.”  
Not as a burden… but as a gentle call to lean toward God, one small step at a time.

In this spoken‑word devotional, we explore the first step of conversion —
a simple, honest re‑orientation toward the One who already walks beside us.
A step that doesn’t demand perfection,
but invites direction, openness, and trust.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why repentance is an invitation, not a reprimand

How conversion mirrors a flower turning toward the sun

Why God meets us in every small yes

A prayer to help you take your next step

A simple daily activity to bring one area of your life into God’s light

If this reflection speaks to you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
