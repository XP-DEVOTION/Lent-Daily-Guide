Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.

Today is Day 7… Tuesday of the First Week of Lent —
and today, God invites you into something many of us struggle to receive:

Mercy.

Psalm 103 tells us,
“The Lord is merciful and gracious,
slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.”

Read that slowly.
Let it sink in.
This is who God is.
Not harsh.
Not impatient.
Not waiting for you to fail.
Not tallying your mistakes.

Merciful.
Gracious.
Slow to anger.
Overflowing with love.

But here’s the truth:
Many of us don’t know how to rest in that.
We know how to work.
We know how to strive.
We know how to apologize,
to try harder,
to fix ourselves,
to earn approval.

But mercy?
Mercy requires receiving.
Mercy requires trust.
Mercy requires letting God love you
in the places you feel least lovable.

And that’s hard.
Because we carry memories,
regrets,
old wounds,
old stories about who we think we are
and who we think God expects us to be.

But Lent is not a season of proving yourself.
It’s a season of remembering yourself —
remembering who you are to God.

And who are you?
You are loved.
You are seen.
You are held.
You are forgiven.
You are wanted.

Not because you earned it.
Not because you performed well.
Not because you prayed perfectly
or fasted flawlessly
or lived without mistakes.

You are loved because God is love.
You are forgiven because God is mercy.
You are held because God delights in holding you.

Mercy is not something you chase.
It’s something you rest in.

So today, let yourself rest.
Let yourself breathe.
Let yourself stop trying to earn what God freely gives.

Maybe you’ve been carrying guilt.
Maybe you’ve been carrying shame.
Maybe you’ve been carrying the weight of expectations
you were never meant to carry.

Lay them down.
Just for today.
Just for this moment.
Let God’s mercy wash over you
like warm water on a tired soul.

Because mercy is not a reward.
It’s a gift.
A gift God loves to give.

So let us pray:  
Merciful Father,
let Your compassion wash over me.
Heal what is wounded within me.
Teach me to rest in Your love.
Amen.

Activity for today:  
Sit quietly for one minute —
just one —
and breathe in the word:
“Mercy.”  
Let it settle into your heart.

Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May God’s mercy surround you,
steady you,
and give rest to your soul.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
