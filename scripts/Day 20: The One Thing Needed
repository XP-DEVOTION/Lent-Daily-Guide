Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.


Today is Day 20… Monday of the Third Week of Lent —
and today, Jesus speaks a word
that cuts through noise,
through pressure,
through distraction,
and goes straight to the heart.

In the home of Martha and Mary,
He says,
“There is need of only one thing.”

One thing.
Not everything.
Not the endless list.
Not the pressure to do it all.
Not the weight of expectations
you’ve been carrying on your shoulders.

Just one thing.

Mary sits at Jesus’ feet,
listening,
resting,
receiving.
Martha is overwhelmed,
pulled in every direction,
trying to serve,
trying to manage,
trying to keep everything together.

And Jesus doesn’t scold Martha for serving.
He doesn’t shame her for caring.
He simply invites her
to remember what matters most.

Because sometimes the good things
can distract us from the essential thing.

Sometimes our schedules
crowd out our souls.
Sometimes our responsibilities
drown out our relationship with God.
Sometimes our desire to do everything
keeps us from receiving anything.

And Jesus says,
“There is need of only one thing.”

Not perfection.
Not performance.
Not productivity.
Presence.

Being with Him.
Listening to Him.
Letting His voice
be louder than the noise around you
and the noise within you.

Maybe today you feel like Martha —
pulled in a dozen directions,
tired,
stretched thin,
trying to hold everything together.

Maybe your mind is cluttered.
Maybe your heart is restless.
Maybe your soul feels scattered.

Jesus isn’t asking you to do more.
He’s asking you to come close.

To sit.
To breathe.
To listen.
To rest.

The “one thing” is not a task.
It’s a relationship.
It’s the quiet space
where your heart meets His.

And here’s the beautiful truth:
When you choose the better part —
when you choose presence over pressure —
everything else finds its place.

Your work becomes lighter.
Your decisions become clearer.
Your heart becomes calmer.
Your soul becomes anchored.

So today, let Jesus simplify your spirit.
Let Him draw you back
to the one thing that matters most.
Let Him remind you
that you don’t have to do everything —
you just have to be with Him.


So let us pray:  
Jesus, draw me back to the one thing.
Quiet my mind,
steady my heart,
and help me rest in Your presence.
Amen.


Activity for today:  
Take two minutes —
just two —
to sit in silence with God.
No words.
No agenda.
Just presence.

Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May the “one thing”
anchor your heart
and guide your steps.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
