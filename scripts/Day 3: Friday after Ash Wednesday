Peace be with you.
Today is Day 3… Friday after Ash Wednesday — and today, the Spirit invites us into a word many of us avoid:

The desert.

When Scripture says, “Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert,”  
it’s easy to imagine a harsh place, a lonely place, a place of emptiness.
And yes… the desert can feel like that.
But the desert is also something else.
Something deeper.
Something sacred.

The desert is not punishment.
It’s preparation.

Jesus didn’t wander into the desert by accident.
He didn’t stumble into it because life got messy.
He was led there — intentionally, purposefully, lovingly — by the Spirit.

And that tells us something important:
Sometimes God leads us into quiet places
so He can strengthen what has grown weak,
clarify what has grown blurry,
and awaken what has grown numb.

The desert is where distractions fade.
Where noise quiets.
Where the heart becomes honest.
Where God becomes clearer.

Maybe you’ve been in a desert season without realizing it.
Maybe life has felt stripped down —
less noise, less comfort, less certainty.
Maybe you’ve been wondering why things feel dry,
why prayer feels harder,
why your heart feels exposed.

But what if this isn’t abandonment?
What if it’s invitation?
What if the Spirit is leading you —
not to break you,
but to build you?

The desert is where Jesus discovered strength He didn’t know He had.
It’s where He faced temptation and chose truth.
It’s where He learned to rely on the Father in a deeper way.
It’s where His mission became clear.

And Lent mirrors that journey.
It invites you into your own desert —
not to overwhelm you,
but to prepare you.
To strip away what doesn’t matter
so you can see what does.

Maybe God is inviting you to step away from something that distracts you.
Maybe He’s calling you to silence,
to simplicity,
to stillness.
Maybe He’s asking you to trust Him in a place that feels unfamiliar.

The desert is uncomfortable, yes.
But it’s also holy ground.
It’s where transformation begins.
It’s where God shapes the heart.
It’s where clarity rises like the morning sun.

So today, don’t fear the desert.
Walk into it with Jesus.
Let the Spirit lead you.
Let the quiet teach you.
Let the simplicity strengthen you.

Because the desert is not the end —
it’s the beginning of something new.


So let us pray:  
Holy Spirit, lead me into the desert with courage.
Shape my heart in this sacred season.
Amen.


Activity for today:  
Turn off one small distraction for the rest of the day —
a notification, a habit, a noise —
and let that little bit of silence
be your desert with God.
