Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.


Today is Day 18… Saturday of the Second Week of Lent —
and today, Jesus brings us into one of the most beautiful,
most comforting,
and most revealing images of God in all of Scripture:

A Father who runs.

In the parable of the Prodigal Son, Jesus says,
“While he was still a long way off,
his father saw him
and was filled with compassion.”

Before the apology.
Before the explanation.
Before the son could clean himself up
or prove he had changed.

The father saw him.
The father ran to him.
The father embraced him.

This is the heart of God.

Not distant.
Not hesitant.
Not waiting for you to get everything right.
Not holding your past against you.

A Father who watches the road.
A Father who notices the smallest turn of your heart.
A Father who runs toward you
the moment you take a single step toward Him.

Maybe today you feel “a long way off.”
A long way off from who you want to be.
A long way off from the prayer life you hoped for.
A long way off from the peace you desire.
A long way off from the person God is calling you to become.

But distance doesn’t discourage God.
It moves Him.

He sees you —
not just where you are,
but where you’re trying to go.
He sees the effort.
He sees the desire.
He sees the longing beneath the struggle.

And He runs.

He runs to meet you
in your weakness,
in your confusion,
in your imperfection,
in your return.

The son expected punishment.
He expected disappointment.
He expected to be treated like a servant.

But the father gave him a robe,
a ring,
sandals,
a feast.

Because God doesn’t restore you halfway.
He restores you fully.
He restores you joyfully.
He restores you as a child —
not a servant,
not a project,
not a problem to fix.

A child.

Maybe there’s a part of your heart
that’s been afraid to come home.
A part that feels unworthy.
A part that feels too messy,
too inconsistent,
too broken.

But hear this clearly:
God is not waiting to scold you.
He is waiting to embrace you.

He is not waiting for perfection.
He is waiting for honesty.

He is not waiting for you to earn love.
He is waiting to give it.

So today, let yourself come home.
Even if it’s imperfect.
Even if it’s hesitant.
Even if it’s just one small step.

Because the Father is already running.


So let us pray:  
Father, draw me back to Your heart.
Meet me in my weakness,
run to me in my return,
and hold me in Your mercy.
Amen.


Activity for today:  
Take one small step toward God —
a prayer,
a moment of honesty,
a quiet return.
Let it be your way of coming home.

Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May the Father’s love meet you
long before you reach the door.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
