Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.

Today is Day 12… the Second Sunday of Lent —
a day that lifts us up a mountain,
into mystery,
into glory,
into the radiant presence of Christ.

The Gospel tells us about the Transfiguration —
that moment when Jesus’ face shone like the sun,
His clothes became dazzling white,
and the disciples saw Him
not just as teacher,
not just as healer,
but as the beloved Son of God.

And from the cloud came a voice:
“This is my beloved Son; listen to Him.”

Listen to Him.
Not just hear Him.
Not just admire Him.
Not just agree with Him when it’s easy.

Listen.

Because listening is the doorway to transformation.
Listening is how the heart changes.
Listening is how we learn to see God
in places we never expected.

But here’s the truth:
We live in a world full of noise.
Noise outside us.
Noise inside us.
Noise that fills our minds,
our schedules,
our hearts.

And Lent invites us to climb the mountain —
to step away from the noise,
to rise above the distractions,
to enter a space where God’s voice
can finally be heard again.

The mountain is not a place of escape.
It’s a place of clarity.
A place where we see Jesus as He truly is —
radiant,
glorious,
beloved.

And when we see Him clearly,
we begin to see ourselves clearly too.

Maybe you’ve been longing for clarity.
Maybe you’ve been praying for direction.
Maybe you’ve been asking God to speak
into a place of confusion or uncertainty.

The Transfiguration reminds us:
God still speaks.
God still reveals.
God still invites you to listen.

But listening requires stillness.
It requires openness.
It requires stepping away from the noise
long enough to hear the whisper of God.

And here’s the beautiful part:
The disciples didn’t stay on the mountain.
They came back down —
back into the ordinary,
back into the messy,
back into the world.

But they came down changed.
Because once you’ve seen Jesus clearly,
you can never see life the same way again.

So today, let this Sunday be your mountain.
Let it be a moment of clarity.
Let it be a moment where you pause long enough
to hear God say to you:

“This is My beloved Son.
Listen to Him.”

And when you listen —
really listen —
you’ll find that His voice
is already guiding you,
already comforting you,
already calling you deeper
into love.

So let us pray:  
Lord, open my ears to Your voice.
Lift me above the noise of life
and help me listen to Your beloved Son
with a clear and trusting heart.
Amen.

Activity for today:  
Spend five minutes in silence —
no phone,
no music,
no distractions.
Just breathe…
and listen.

Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May God give you ears to hear
and a heart ready to listen.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
