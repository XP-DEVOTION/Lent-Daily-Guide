Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.

Today is Day 8… Wednesday of the First Week of Lent —
and today, God invites you into a different kind of seeing.
Not with your eyes,
but with your heart.

The psalmist prays,
“Search me, O God, and know my heart.”  
It’s a bold prayer.
A vulnerable prayer.
A prayer that says,
“Lord, show me what I can’t see on my own.”

Because Lent is a season of clarity.
A season where God gently reveals
what distracts you,
what burdens you,
what dims your vision,
and what draws you closer to Him.

But here’s the thing:
God doesn’t reveal these things to shame you.
He reveals them to free you.
To heal you.
To help you see your life, your choices, your desires
with new eyes —
eyes shaped by truth,
eyes shaped by love.

Sometimes we go through life on autopilot.
We repeat habits without thinking.
We carry burdens without questioning.
We cling to distractions without noticing.
We move so fast that we stop paying attention
to what’s happening inside us.

But Lent slows us down.
It invites us to look inward —
not with harsh judgment,
but with gentle honesty.

Maybe there’s something in your life
that’s been pulling your attention away from God.
Maybe there’s a pattern you’ve ignored,
a wound you’ve avoided,
a distraction you’ve accepted as normal.

God isn’t pointing these things out to condemn you.
He’s pointing them out because He loves you.
Because He wants you free.
Because He wants you whole.

Seeing with new eyes means letting God show you
what needs healing,
what needs surrender,
what needs light.

And it also means seeing the good —
the growth you didn’t notice,
the strength you didn’t realize you had,
the grace that’s been quietly shaping you.

Lent is not just about seeing what’s wrong.
It’s about seeing what’s true.
Seeing yourself as God sees you —
with compassion,
with clarity,
with hope.

So today, let your prayer be simple:
“Lord, open my eyes.”
Open my eyes to what needs healing.
Open my eyes to what needs letting go.
Open my eyes to Your presence in my life.

Because when God opens your eyes,
He doesn’t just show you your heart —
He shows you His.

So let us pray:  
Lord, open my eyes.
Help me notice what needs healing
and what needs surrender.
Search my heart with gentleness,
and lead me into Your light.
Amen.

Activity for today:  
Write down one distraction
you want to release this week.
Just one.
Name it honestly…
and let that be the beginning of clarity.


Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May God open your eyes
to His presence,
His truth,
and His love.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
