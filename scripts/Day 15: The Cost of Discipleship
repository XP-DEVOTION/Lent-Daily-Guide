Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.

Today is Day 15… Wednesday of the Second Week of Lent —
and today, Jesus invites us to look at something
we often admire from a distance
but struggle to embrace up close:

The cost of discipleship.

Jesus says,
“The Son of Man did not come to be served
but to serve.”

Think about that.
The One who created the universe…
the One who holds galaxies in His hands…
the One who commands angels…
came not to be served,
but to serve.

He chose the lowest place.
He chose the humble path.
He chose the towel,
not the throne.
He chose the cross,
not the crown.

And He invites us to follow Him there.

But following Jesus isn’t just about believing in Him.
It’s about becoming like Him.
It’s about letting His way
become your way.
His posture
become your posture.
His heart
become your heart.

And that comes with a cost.

The cost of discipleship is not money.
It’s not status.
It’s not success.
The cost is your comfort.
Your pride.
Your need to be first.
Your desire to be in control.

Discipleship means choosing service
over self‑importance.
It means choosing compassion
over convenience.
It means choosing sacrifice
over comfort.

And yet —
this cost is not a burden.
It’s a gift.
Because when you serve,
you become free.
When you give,
you become full.
When you lower yourself,
God lifts you up.

Maybe there’s a place in your life
where Jesus is inviting you to serve —
quietly,
humbly,
without applause,
without recognition.

Maybe it’s in your home.
Maybe it’s in your workplace.
Maybe it’s in your parish.
Maybe it’s with someone
who can’t repay you.

Service is not glamorous.
It’s not dramatic.
It’s not Instagram‑worthy.

But it is holy.
It is Christ‑like.
It is the path of real discipleship.

And here’s the beautiful truth:
When you serve,
you meet Jesus.
You meet Him in the small things.
You meet Him in the hidden places.
You meet Him in the faces of the people
you choose to love.

Discipleship costs something —
but what it gives
is infinitely more.

So let us pray:  
Jesus, make my heart like Yours.
Teach me to serve with humility,
to love without counting the cost,
and to follow You
wherever You lead.
Amen.

Activity for today:  
Do one hidden act of service —
something no one will see,
no one will praise,
no one will thank you for.
Let it be your quiet offering to God.

Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May the heart of Christ
shape your steps
and guide your service.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
