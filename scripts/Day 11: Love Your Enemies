Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.


Today is Day 11… Saturday of the First Week of Lent —
and today, Jesus brings us to one of the most radical,
most uncomfortable,
and most transformative teachings in the entire Gospel:

“Love your enemies,
and pray for those who persecute you.”

It’s a command that stops us in our tracks.
Because loving the people who love us —
that’s easy.
Loving the people who treat us well —
that comes naturally.
But loving the people who hurt us,
ignore us,
misunderstand us,
or oppose us —
that feels impossible.

And maybe that’s the point.
Jesus isn’t asking you to do what’s easy.
He’s inviting you into what’s divine.

Because loving difficult people
is not about approving their behavior.
It’s not about pretending the hurt didn’t happen.
It’s not about letting someone walk all over you.
It’s not about being naïve or passive.

Loving your enemies means refusing to let hatred
take root in your heart.
It means choosing mercy over bitterness.
It means praying for the people
you’d rather avoid.
It means letting God’s love flow through you
even when your emotions don’t agree.

And here’s the truth:
You can’t do this on your own.
You weren’t meant to.
This kind of love —
enemy‑love,
cross‑shaped love,
Christ‑like love —
is only possible through grace.

Maybe there’s someone in your life
who drains you,
frustrates you,
or wounds you.
Someone you’ve tried to forgive,
but the hurt keeps resurfacing.
Someone you’ve tried to love,
but the relationship feels stuck.

Jesus isn’t asking you to feel love.
He’s asking you to choose love.
To pray for them.
To release resentment.
To let God soften what has grown hard.

Because when you pray for someone who hurt you,
you’re not excusing them —
you’re freeing yourself.
You’re letting God heal the wound
instead of letting bitterness deepen it.

Enemy‑love is not about them.
It’s about you.
It’s about your heart.
Your freedom.
Your peace.

And here’s the beautiful mystery:
When you pray for someone who hurt you,
God often begins healing places in you
that you didn’t even realize were wounded.

So today, let this teaching stretch you.
Let it challenge you.
Let it open you.
Let it make you more like Christ.

Not because it’s easy —
but because it’s holy.

So let us pray:  
Jesus, teach me how to love like You.
Give me the grace to pray for those who have hurt me,
and heal the places in my heart
that still carry pain.
Amen.

Activity for today:  
Pray for one difficult person —
just one.
Say their name before God
and ask for peace, healing, and grace
for both of you.

Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May God give you the courage
to love with a heart like Christ.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
