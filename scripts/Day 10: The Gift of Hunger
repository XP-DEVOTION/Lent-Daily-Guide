Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.


Today is Day 10… Friday of the First Week of Lent —
and today, God invites you to pay attention
to something you might normally ignore:

Your hunger.

Not just physical hunger —
but the deeper kind.
The ache beneath the surface.
The longing that rises in quiet moments.
The desire you can’t quite name
but you feel it all the same.

Your guide for today says it beautifully:

“Spiritual hunger is a sign of life.
It is God stirring your heart, drawing you deeper.”

Hunger is not a problem.
Hunger is a gift.
Hunger is the soul’s way of saying,
“There is more…
and I was made for it.”

The psalmist prays,
“My soul longs for You, O God.”  
Not casually.
Not occasionally.
But deeply —
like a thirst that won’t go away.

Maybe you’ve felt that lately.
A restlessness.
A desire for something real.
A longing for peace,
for clarity,
for connection,
for God.

Sometimes we try to fill that hunger
with noise,
with busyness,
with comfort,
with distraction.
But nothing satisfies
because nothing else was meant to.

Your hunger is holy.
It is God awakening something in you.
It is God drawing you closer.
It is God whispering,
“Come to Me.
Let Me be your fullness.”

Lent is the season
where hunger becomes prayer.
Where longing becomes invitation.
Where emptiness becomes space
for God to enter.

Maybe today you feel spiritually hungry —
for direction,
for healing,
for meaning,
for God’s presence.

Don’t push that feeling away.
Don’t numb it.
Don’t rush past it.

Let it speak.
Let it rise.
Let it lead you.

Because hunger is not a sign
that something is wrong.
It’s a sign that something is growing.

God is stirring your heart.
God is awakening desire.
God is preparing you
for deeper communion with Him.

So today, don’t fear the hunger.
Welcome it.
Honor it.
Let it become your prayer.

So let us pray:  
Lord, deepen my desire for You.
Let my hunger become prayer,
and let my longing lead me closer
to Your heart.
Amen.


Before your next meal,
pause for a moment
and thank God
for the hunger of your soul —
the hunger that draws you to Him.


Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May your hunger lead you
not to emptiness,
but to God’s fullness.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
