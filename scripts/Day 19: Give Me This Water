Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.

Today is Day 19… the Third Sunday of Lent —
and today, Jesus meets us at a well.

Not a temple.
Not a mountaintop.
Not a place of prestige or holiness.

A well.
A place of thirst.
A place of need.
A place where people come
because something inside them
is empty.

And there, Jesus meets a woman
who is tired,
wounded,
misunderstood,
and carrying more than she can say out loud.

He asks her for water —
but really,
He is offering her something deeper.

Living water.
Healing water.
Water that reaches the places
nothing else can reach.

And she says,
“Sir, give me this water.”

It’s a simple sentence,
but it carries the weight of a lifetime.
A lifetime of searching.
A lifetime of disappointment.
A lifetime of longing for something
that finally satisfies.

Maybe you know that feeling.
Maybe you’ve been drinking from wells
that don’t satisfy —
wells of achievement,
wells of approval,
wells of distraction,
wells of comfort,
wells of control.

They help for a moment…
but the thirst always returns.

Because the human heart
was made for more.

Jesus doesn’t shame the woman.
He doesn’t expose her to embarrass her.
He reveals her story
so He can heal it.
He names her wounds
so He can pour living water into them.

And He does the same for you.

He meets you
not at your strongest point,
but at your thirstiest.
Not where you feel holy,
but where you feel empty.
Not where you feel confident,
but where you feel tired.

Because that is where grace flows best.

Maybe today you feel spiritually dry.
Maybe prayer feels distant.
Maybe life feels heavy.
Maybe your soul feels thirsty
in a way you can’t quite explain.

Jesus meets you there.
At the well.
In the heat of the day.
In the place you didn’t expect Him.
And He offers you living water —
not a quick fix,
not a temporary comfort,
but a deep, renewing,
soul‑quenching grace.

And all He asks is the same simple prayer
the woman prayed:

“Lord… give me this water.”

Give me what I cannot give myself.
Give me what the world cannot offer.
Give me what my soul has been longing for.

Let today be a day of honesty.
A day of thirst.
A day of receiving.

Because Jesus is still sitting at the well,
waiting for you,
ready to pour living water
into the deepest places of your heart.


So let us pray:  
Jesus, give me Your living water.
Quench the thirst in my soul
and fill the places that feel empty.
Meet me at the well
and renew my heart.
Amen.


Activity for today:  
Take one moment of silence
and simply pray:
“Lord, give me this water.”
Let that be your invitation
to receive His grace.

Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May the living water of Christ
refresh your soul
and renew your heart.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
