Peace be with you.
And welcome to this journey.
Today is Day 1… Ash Wednesday — the beginning of Lent, the beginning of a return, the beginning of something God has been waiting to do in your heart.

Ash Wednesday doesn’t arrive with noise.
It doesn’t force its way into your schedule.
It comes quietly…
like a gentle knock on the door of your soul.
A whisper from God saying,
“Return to Me with all your heart.”

And maybe…
maybe you’ve been far.
Maybe you’ve been distracted.
Maybe you’ve been tired, overwhelmed, or just spiritually numb.
Or maybe you’ve been close, but longing for something deeper.
Wherever you are — this day meets you there.

Lent is not a test.
It’s not a performance.
It’s not a spiritual competition.
It’s an invitation.
A slow turning of the heart.
A quiet walk back home.

The ashes placed on your forehead today —
they’re not a symbol of failure.
They’re not meant to shame you or shrink you.
They’re a reminder of tenderness.
A reminder that you are dust…
but dust that God shaped with His own hands.
Dust that God breathed life into.
Dust that God loves.

Even in your fragility,
even in your limits,
even in the places where you feel small or broken —
God leans close.
He whispers your name.
And He says,
“I’m still here.
I’ve always been here.
Come home.”

Ash Wednesday is the doorway.
It’s the threshold.
It’s the moment where you pause,
take a breath,
and say,
“Lord… I’m ready to return.”

And maybe returning feels scary.
Maybe it feels vulnerable.
Maybe you’re not sure what you’re returning from  
or what you’re returning to.  
That’s okay.
God isn’t asking you to have it all figured out.
He’s asking for your heart —
as it is,
not as you wish it were.

Lent is a journey of honesty.
A journey of hope.
A journey of letting God meet you in the real places —
the tired places,
the hidden places,
the longing places.

So today…
let your heart breathe.
Let it soften.
Let it turn, even just a little,
toward the One who has never stopped loving you.


And now…
So let us pray:

Lord, I return to You with honesty and hope.
Receive my heart,
and renew my desire for You.
Amen.


Activity for today:  
At some point —
maybe in a quiet hallway,
maybe while you’re washing dishes,
maybe in the car,
or in a moment when no one else is watching —
just whisper,
“Lord, I return to You.”

Let that simple sentence be your first step home.
Let it be the seed of something new.
Let it be the beginning of a Lent that changes you gently,
deeply,
and beautifully.
