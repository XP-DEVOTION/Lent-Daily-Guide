Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your soul settle…
and let’s step into today together.


Today is Day 4… Saturday after Ash Wednesday —
and today, the Gospel invites us into something simple,
something challenging,
and something deeply beautiful:

The first step of conversion.

Jesus says,
“Repent and believe in the Gospel.”  
And for many of us, that word — repent —
comes with a lot of weight.
We hear it and think of guilt,
or shame,
or pressure to change everything all at once.

But that’s not what Jesus is doing here.
He’s not scolding.
He’s inviting.
He’s calling you closer.

Conversion isn’t a dramatic moment.
It’s not a spiritual makeover.
It’s not a single decision that magically fixes everything.

Conversion is a turning.
A gentle re‑orientation.
A shift of the heart toward God.

Think of a flower turning toward the sun.
It doesn’t snap into place.
It doesn’t force itself.
It simply leans —
slowly, steadily, naturally —
toward the light that gives it life.

That’s conversion.

And Lent is the season where God whispers,
“Just turn a little.
Lean toward Me.
Take one step.”

Maybe that step is honesty —
finally admitting something you’ve been avoiding.
Maybe it’s surrender —
letting go of something you’ve been gripping too tightly.
Maybe it’s trust —
believing God can work even in the places you feel stuck.

Conversion is not about perfection.
It’s about direction.

It’s about saying,
“Lord, I want to come closer.
Show me how.”
And here’s the beauty:
God meets you in every small yes.
Every tiny opening.
Every quiet desire for more.

He doesn’t wait for you at the finish line.
He walks with you from the very first step.

So today, don’t try to transform your whole life.
Don’t try to fix everything.
Don’t try to force change.

Just take one step.
One honest step.
One willing step.
One step of conversion.

Because God can do more with one sincere step
than you can do with a thousand forced ones.

Let today be gentle.
Let it be simple.
Let it be the beginning of something deeper.

So let us pray:  
Lord, turn my heart toward You.
Help me take the next step of conversion.
Meet me in my small yes,
and lead me closer to Your love.
Amen.


Activity for today:  
Name one area of your life that needs God’s light.
Just one.
Hold it gently before Him…
and let that be your step.

Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May God meet you in every small step you take.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
