Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.


Today is Day 9… Thursday of the First Week of Lent —
and today, Jesus speaks a word
that reaches into the places
we try hardest to hide.

He says,
“My grace is sufficient for you.”

It’s a sentence that dismantles the illusion
that you have to be strong all the time.
That you have to hold everything together.
That you have to carry every burden
with a steady smile
and a silent heart.

But Lent is honest.
Lent is real.
Lent invites you to stop pretending
and start surrendering.

Your guide for today says it beautifully:

“You don’t need to hold everything together.
God meets you in weakness and fills you with His strength.”

Weakness is not failure.
Weakness is not shame.
Weakness is the doorway
where grace enters.

Maybe you’ve been trying to be strong
for your family,
for your friends,
for your work,
for your own expectations.
Maybe you’ve been carrying a weight
you never talk about —
a quiet fear,
a hidden exhaustion,
a pressure that keeps tightening.

And maybe you’ve believed
that if you just try harder,
push further,
stay tougher,
you’ll finally feel okay.

But Jesus whispers,
“Let go.
Let Me carry what you can’t.”

False strength is the armor we build
when we’re afraid to be seen.
True strength is the grace God gives
when we dare to be honest.

Lent invites you to lay down the armor.
To stop pretending you’re unbreakable.
To stop measuring your worth
by how much you can endure.

Because God is not asking you
to be invincible.
He is asking you
to be open.

Open enough to receive His strength.
Open enough to admit your limits.
Open enough to say,
“Lord, I can’t do this alone.”

And here’s the miracle:
When you stop clinging to false strength,
you make room for real strength —
the kind that doesn’t crack under pressure,
the kind that doesn’t depend on performance,
the kind that flows from God Himself.

So today, let yourself be human.
Let yourself be held.
Let yourself be carried
by the One whose grace
is always enough.

So let us pray:  
Jesus, I surrender my false strength.
Meet me in my weakness
and fill me with Your courage,
Your peace,
Your grace.
Amen.


Tell God one area where you feel weak today.  
Just one.
Name it honestly —
and let that honesty become prayer.


Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May God’s strength meet you
right where your strength ends.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
