Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.

Today is Day 16… Thursday of the Second Week of Lent —
and today, God speaks a word
that is both bold and tender,
both challenging and comforting,
both honest and full of hope.

He says,
“Though your sins be like scarlet,
they shall become white as snow.”

This is not a threat.
This is not a warning.
This is an invitation —
an invitation into mercy,
into healing,
into a love that refuses to give up on you.

Because here’s the truth:
We all carry things we wish we didn’t.
Mistakes.
Regrets.
Patterns we can’t seem to break.
Moments we replay in our minds
with a sting of shame or sadness.

Sometimes we think these things define us.
Sometimes we think they disqualify us.
Sometimes we think they place us
outside the reach of God’s love.

But God looks at all of it —
every failure,
every flaw,
every scarlet stain —
and says,
“I can make this new.”

God is not shocked by your weakness.
He’s not surprised by your struggles.
He’s not discouraged by your imperfections.
He’s not keeping a tally of your failures.

He is the God who restores.
The God who cleanses.
The God who renews.
The God who makes scarlet things
white as snow.

But here’s the beautiful part:
God doesn’t ask you to fix yourself first.
He doesn’t ask you to earn forgiveness.
He doesn’t ask you to hide your wounds
or pretend you’re stronger than you are.

He simply asks you to come.
Come as you are.
Come honestly.
Come with your mess,
your weakness,
your sin,
your need.

Because transformation doesn’t begin
with your effort.
It begins with God’s mercy.

Maybe there’s something in your life
you’ve been afraid to bring to God —
a habit,
a memory,
a sin that feels too heavy,
too old,
too deep.

But God is not afraid of your darkness.
He steps into it.
He speaks into it.
He heals it.

Lent is not a season of self‑condemnation.
It’s a season of return.
A season of renewal.
A season where God whispers,
“Let Me make you new.”

So today, let yourself believe
that nothing in you is beyond God’s mercy.
Nothing is too stained.
Nothing is too broken.
Nothing is too far gone.

The God who makes snow fall
on barren ground
can make grace fall
on your heart.

So let us pray:  
Lord, wash me in Your mercy.
Heal what is wounded,
cleanse what is stained,
and make me new in Your love.
Amen.

Activity for today:  
Bring one area of your life —
just one —
into God’s light.
Name it honestly,
and ask Him to make it new.

Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May God’s mercy renew your heart
and make all things new within you.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
