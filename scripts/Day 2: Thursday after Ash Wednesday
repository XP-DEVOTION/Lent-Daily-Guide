Peace be with you.
Today is Day 2… Thursday after Ash Wednesday — the second step on this Lenten journey, and a day that invites us to remember something simple, something humbling, and something strangely beautiful:

You are dust.
And to dust you shall return.

We hear those words every year, but today… let’s slow down and let them breathe.
Because “dust” doesn’t mean what we often think it means.
It doesn’t mean worthless.
It doesn’t mean insignificant.
It doesn’t mean disposable.

Dust is where the story begins.

God reached down into the earth, into the dust, and shaped humanity with His own hands.
He didn’t speak us into existence from a distance.
He formed us up close.
He breathed His own breath into us.
He held us before we ever took our first breath.

So when Scripture says, “You are dust,”  
it’s not an insult.
It’s a reminder of intimacy.
A reminder of craftsmanship.
A reminder that you were made intentionally, lovingly, and with care.

Dust is not a sign of smallness —
it’s a sign of closeness.

And Lent brings us back to that truth.
It brings us back to humility,
not the kind that shames you,
but the kind that frees you.
The kind that says,
“I don’t have to be everything.
I don’t have to hold the world together.
I don’t have to pretend I’m limitless.”

Because I am dust…
and God loves this dust.

Maybe you’ve been carrying too much.
Maybe you’ve been trying to be stronger than you really feel.
Maybe you’ve been stretching yourself thin,
trying to be perfect,
trying to be unbreakable,
trying to be more than human.

But today, Lent whispers:
“You don’t have to be more than human.
You just have to be God’s.”

Humility isn’t about shrinking.
It’s about remembering who holds you.
It’s about remembering that your limits are not failures —
they’re invitations.
Invitations to trust.
Invitations to breathe.
Invitations to rest in the God who formed you,
who sustains you,
who carries you.

So today, let yourself be dust —
not in a defeated way,
but in a beloved way.
Let yourself be held.
Let yourself be small enough for God to be big in your life.
Let yourself be honest enough to say,
“Lord, I need You.”

Because the God who shaped you from dust
is the same God who lifts you,
guides you,
and breathes life into you again and again.


So let us pray:  
Jesus, teach me humility.
Help me embrace my limits
and trust Your strength.
Amen.


Activity for today:  
Pause at some point today —
maybe right now,
maybe later when life slows down —
and take one deep, intentional breath.
As you inhale, remember:
“I am held by God.”
Let that truth settle into your bones.


Peace be with you.
