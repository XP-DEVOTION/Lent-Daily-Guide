Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.

Today is Day 9… Thursday of the First Week of Lent —
and today, Jesus gives us one of the simplest,
most comforting,
and most challenging invitations in the Gospel:

Ask.
Seek.
Knock.

Three small words.
Three movements of the heart.
Three ways of saying,
“Don’t give up.
Don’t stay silent.
Don’t walk away from the God who loves you.”

But let’s be honest —
asking isn’t always easy.
Seeking isn’t always clear.
Knocking doesn’t always feel natural.

Sometimes we don’t ask because we’re afraid of the answer.
Sometimes we don’t seek because we’re tired of searching.
Sometimes we don’t knock because we’re not sure the door will open.

But Jesus doesn’t say,
“Ask perfectly.”
He doesn’t say,
“Seek with confidence.”
He doesn’t say,
“Knock loudly.”

He simply says:
Ask.
Seek.
Knock.

Even if your voice trembles.
Even if your search feels uncertain.
Even if your knock is barely a tap.

Because God is not measuring the strength of your effort —
He’s listening for the movement of your heart.

Asking is an act of trust.
Seeking is an act of desire.
Knocking is an act of hope.

And Lent is the season where God invites you
to bring your real needs,
your real questions,
your real longings
into His presence.

Maybe there’s something you’ve been afraid to ask for —
healing, clarity, courage, forgiveness.
Maybe there’s something you’ve been seeking —
direction, peace, purpose, a sense of belonging.
Maybe there’s a door you’ve been standing in front of —
a door you’re not sure you’re worthy to knock on.

But Jesus says:
Ask.
Seek.
Knock.
Because the Father’s heart is open.
Because God is not hiding from you.
Because heaven is not distant.
Because love is not reluctant.

Sometimes the answer comes quickly.
Sometimes slowly.
Sometimes differently than you expected.
But God always responds —
not always with what you want,
but always with what you need.

So today, let yourself ask.
Let yourself seek.
Let yourself knock.
Not because you’re strong,
but because God is good.

So let us pray:  
Lord, give me the courage to ask,
the desire to seek,
and the hope to knock.
Open my heart to Your goodness
and guide me in Your love.
Amen.

Activity for today:  
Ask God for one specific thing —
just one —
with honesty and trust.
Let that be your prayer today.

Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May your asking, seeking, and knocking
lead you deeper into God’s heart.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
