Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.


Today is Day 6… Monday of the First Week of Lent —
a day that invites us into something subtle,
something hidden,
something we often overlook:

The quiet work of grace.

Jesus tells a simple story —
a farmer plants a seed,
goes about his life,
and somehow…
without his effort,
without his understanding,
without his control…
the seed grows.

“The seed grows, though he does not know how.”

There is something profoundly comforting in that.
Because so much of our spiritual life happens beneath the surface.
So much of God’s work in us is quiet,
unseen,
slow,
and deeply interior.

We live in a world that celebrates instant results —
quick progress,
visible change,
measurable improvement.
But grace doesn’t work like that.
Grace is patient.
Grace is gentle.
Grace is steady.

And most of the time,
you don’t notice it while it’s happening.

Think about it:
You don’t feel your heart growing softer.
You don’t feel your patience expanding.
You don’t feel your faith deepening.
You don’t feel your soul being reshaped.

But slowly…
quietly…
God is cultivating something in you.

Maybe you’ve been praying and wondering if anything is changing.
Maybe you’ve been trying to grow,
trying to heal,
trying to trust,
and it feels like nothing is happening.

But seeds don’t sprout the moment they’re planted.
Roots form first —
hidden, silent, essential.

And that’s what God is doing in you.
He’s forming roots.
Strengthening foundations.
Preparing you for growth you can’t yet see.

Lent reminds us that transformation is rarely dramatic.
It’s usually subtle.
It’s usually slow.
It’s usually quiet.

And that’s okay.
Because God is not in a hurry.
He’s not impatient with your pace.
He’s not disappointed with your progress.
He’s working in the hidden places —
the places you don’t see,
the places you don’t understand,
the places you don’t control.

Your job is not to force growth.
Your job is to stay open.
To stay faithful.
To keep showing up.
To trust the God who works in silence.

So today, let yourself rest in that truth:
Grace is growing in you —
even if you don’t feel it.
Even if you don’t see it.
Even if you don’t understand it.

God is doing something deep.
Something real.
Something beautiful.
And in time…
it will rise.


So let us pray:  
Lord, give me patience with Your timing.
Help me trust the quiet work You are doing in me.
Amen.


Activity for today:  
Do one ordinary task —
washing a dish,
folding a shirt,
walking to your car —
slowly and prayerfully.
Let it remind you that God works quietly,
even in the smallest moments.


Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May you trust the quiet work of grace unfolding within you.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
