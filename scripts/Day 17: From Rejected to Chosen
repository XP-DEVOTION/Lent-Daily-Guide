Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.

Today is Day 17… Friday of the Second Week of Lent —
and today, God speaks a word
to anyone who has ever felt overlooked,
dismissed,
misunderstood,
or rejected.

The psalm says,
“The stone the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone.”

It’s a powerful image.
A stone tossed aside,
deemed unworthy,
unusable,
insignificant…
becomes the foundation
of something beautiful,
something strong,
something essential.

This is the way God works.
He sees what others miss.
He chooses what others overlook.
He lifts what others push aside.
He builds with what others discard.

And maybe that speaks to you today.

Maybe there’s a part of your story
that feels like rejection.
A moment where someone didn’t choose you.
A door that didn’t open.
A relationship that didn’t last.
A dream that didn’t unfold
the way you hoped it would.

Maybe you’ve felt like that stone —
set aside,
unseen,
unwanted.

But God sees differently.
God builds differently.
God chooses differently.

The places where you feel rejected
are often the very places
where God is preparing to build something new.

Rejection is not the end of your story.
It’s the beginning of a different one.

Sometimes God allows certain doors to close
because they were too small for the person
He is shaping you to become.
Sometimes He lets certain people walk away
because they were not meant to carry
the next chapter of your life.
Sometimes He removes you from places
where you were never meant to fit
so He can place you where you truly belong.

The cornerstone is not chosen
because it is perfect.
It is chosen because it is strong.
Because it can bear weight.
Because it can hold what is built upon it.

And maybe the weight you’ve carried,
the wounds you’ve endured,
the rejections you’ve survived
have shaped you into someone
God can build something beautiful upon.

Lent reminds us that God is a builder —
a restorer,
a redeemer,
a craftsman of the heart.

He takes what is broken
and makes it whole.
He takes what is rejected
and makes it essential.
He takes what is overlooked
and makes it foundational.

So today, let this truth settle into your soul:
You are not rejected.
You are chosen.
You are not forgotten.
You are seen.
You are not discarded.
You are being shaped
for something only God can see right now.

The stone the world rejected
is the stone God uses
to build something eternal.


So let us pray:  
Lord, take the rejected places in my life
and make them new.
Build something beautiful
from the parts of me that feel unseen.
Help me trust Your vision
more than the world’s judgment.
Amen.

Activity for today:  
Name one moment of rejection from your life —
and ask God to show you
how He is building something new from it.


Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May the God who sees you
lift you, shape you,
and build something beautiful in your life.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
