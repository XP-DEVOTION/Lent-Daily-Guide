Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.

Today is Day 5… the First Sunday of Lent —
a day that invites us to look at fasting with new eyes,
new depth,
and new purpose.

For many of us, fasting feels like giving something up.
Letting go of a comfort.
Saying “no” to something we enjoy.
And yes — fasting includes sacrifice.
But Scripture takes us deeper.
Much deeper.

God says,
“Is this not the fast I choose:
to loosen the bonds of injustice?”

In other words…
fasting isn’t about deprivation.
It’s about freedom.
It’s about making space —
space for God,
space for compassion,
space for love to move more freely in your life.

When you let go of something,
you’re not just removing a habit.
You’re creating room.
Room for clarity.
Room for prayer.
Room for God to speak.
Room for your heart to soften toward others.

Fasting is not about proving your strength.
It’s about discovering your dependence.
It’s about remembering that you don’t live by bread alone —
you live by the Word,
the presence,
the love of God.

And here’s the beautiful part:
True fasting always opens outward.
It doesn’t end with you.
It flows into compassion.
It awakens empathy.
It loosens the bonds of injustice —
in your own heart
and in the world around you.

Maybe the fast God is inviting you into
isn’t just about food.
Maybe it’s fasting from negativity.
From comparison.
From resentment.
From the need to control.
From the noise that keeps you from hearing His voice.

Or maybe it’s fasting from comfort
so someone else can experience comfort.
Maybe it’s letting go of something small
so you can pray for someone who is suffering in a big way.

Fasting is not about emptying your life.
It’s about filling it —
with purpose,
with compassion,
with God.

So today, don’t think of fasting as losing something.
Think of it as making space.
Think of it as clearing a path.
Think of it as opening your hands
so God can place something new inside them.

Let this Sunday be a reminder:
Fasting is freedom.
Fasting is love.
Fasting is a doorway
into a deeper, more generous heart.

So let us pray:  
God, purify my fasting.
Let it draw me closer to You
and closer to those in need.
Amen.

Activity for today:  
Fast from one comfort —
just one —
and offer it for someone who suffers.
Let your sacrifice become a prayer.

Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May your fasting today open your heart
and make space for God’s love to move.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
