📌 YouTube Title
Day 10: The Courage to Forgive | Friday of the First Week of Lent (Lent Devotional)

📌 YouTube Description
Forgiveness is some of the hardest work the heart ever does —
and some of the most freeing.

Welcome to Day 10 of our Lent journey.
Today’s reflection brings us into the deep, vulnerable place where Jesus invites us to forgive — not quickly, not perfectly, but honestly. Forgiveness isn’t pretending, forgetting, or excusing. It’s releasing the grip that pain has on your heart so it no longer shapes your future.

This spoken‑word devotional gently guides you into that slow, brave work — the kind God walks with you through, step by step.

In today’s reflection, you’ll hear:

Why forgiveness is freedom, not denial

How Jesus understands the weight of your wounds

Why forgiveness is a journey, not a moment

A prayer for courage, healing, and mercy

A simple daily activity to begin naming one person you want to forgive

If this reflection speaks to you, consider journeying with us through all 40 days of Lent.

Peace be with you.
