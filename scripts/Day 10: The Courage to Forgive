🎙️ 4–5 Minute Spoken‑Word Script — Day 10: Friday of the First Week of Lent
(Warm, human, devotional, cinematic — with intro & outro)

[Soft, reflective music begins — something gentle, steady, like a quiet heartbeat]

INTRO (series intro)
Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.

DAY 10 MESSAGE
Today is Day 10… Friday of the First Week of Lent —
and today, Jesus brings us face‑to‑face with one of the hardest,
most transformative invitations of the Gospel:

Forgiveness.

He says,
“Forgive, and you will be forgiven.”

It sounds simple.
But forgiveness is rarely simple.
Forgiveness is heart‑work.
Forgiveness is slow.
Forgiveness is messy.
Forgiveness is brave.

Because to forgive means to let go of something
you’ve been holding tightly —
a wound,
a memory,
a disappointment,
a betrayal,
a moment that hurt you more than you ever admitted.

Forgiveness doesn’t mean pretending it didn’t happen.
It doesn’t mean saying it was okay.
It doesn’t mean trusting someone who hasn’t changed.
It doesn’t mean forgetting.

Forgiveness means releasing the grip that pain has on your heart
so it no longer shapes your future.

Forgiveness is freedom —
not for the one who hurt you,
but for you.

And Jesus knows how hard this is.
He knows how deep wounds can go.
He knows how heavy resentment can feel.
He knows how tightly we hold onto the things that broke us.

But He also knows what unforgiveness does to the soul.
How it hardens us.
How it drains us.
How it steals our peace.
How it closes our hearts to grace.

So Jesus invites us — gently, patiently —
to begin the work of forgiveness.
Not all at once.
Not perfectly.
Not with forced emotion.

Just begin.

Maybe today forgiveness looks like whispering,
“Lord, help me want to forgive.”
Maybe it looks like loosening your grip
on a memory that has held you captive.
Maybe it looks like choosing not to replay the hurt again.
Maybe it looks like praying for the strength
to take one small step toward healing.

Forgiveness is not a moment.
It’s a journey.
A journey God walks with you.
A journey where grace meets you
in every small release,
every quiet surrender,
every softening of the heart.

And here’s the beautiful truth:
When you forgive,
you make space for God to heal you.
You make space for peace.
You make space for freedom.
You make space for joy to return.

Forgiveness doesn’t change the past —
but it transforms the future.

So today, let forgiveness be your offering.
Let it be your courage.
Let it be your step toward freedom.

PRAYER
So let us pray:  
Lord, give me the courage to forgive.
Heal the places in me that still hurt,
and soften my heart with Your mercy.
Amen.

ACTIVITY
Activity for today:  
Name one person —
just one —
you want to begin forgiving.
You don’t have to feel it.
Just name them before God…
and let that be your first step.

OUTRO (series outro)
Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May God give you the courage to forgive
and the grace to heal.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.

[Music fades like a gentle release]
