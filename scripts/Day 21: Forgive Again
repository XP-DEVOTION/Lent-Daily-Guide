Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.

Today is Day 21… Tuesday of the Third Week of Lent —
the final day of this 21‑day journey.
And Jesus ends this stretch of the road
with a question that every one of us
has asked at some point:

“How often must I forgive?”

Peter asks it honestly.
He’s not trying to be clever.
He’s trying to understand
the limits of love,
the boundaries of mercy,
the point where forgiveness
finally runs out.

And Jesus answers with a number
that isn’t really a number at all —
seventy times seven.
In other words:

Forgiveness without limits.
Mercy without counting.
Love without keeping score.

But let’s be real —
forgiveness is hard.
Especially when the wound is deep.
Especially when the hurt repeats.
Especially when the person never apologizes
or never changes.

Forgiveness is not forgetting.
It’s not pretending.
It’s not letting someone hurt you again.
It’s not minimizing the pain.

Forgiveness is releasing the weight
that has been crushing your heart.
It’s choosing freedom
over bitterness.
It’s choosing healing
over resentment.
It’s choosing peace
over the endless replay
of what went wrong.

And here’s the truth:
Forgiveness is not a single moment.
It’s a process.
A journey.
Sometimes a long one.

You forgive…
and then the memory returns.
You forgive…
and then the anger resurfaces.
You forgive…
and then the wound aches again.

And Jesus says,
“Yes.
Forgive again.
And again.
And again.”

Not because the other person deserves it —
but because you deserve peace.

Forgiveness is not about excusing the past.
It’s about reclaiming your future.

Maybe there’s someone in your life
you’ve been struggling to forgive.
Maybe it’s a person.
Maybe it’s a moment.
Maybe it’s yourself.

Maybe you’ve been carrying a weight
that God never asked you to carry.
Maybe today is the day
to loosen your grip
and let grace do what only grace can do.

This is the final day of our 21‑day journey —
and it ends with release.
With freedom.
With a heart that is lighter
because it has learned
to let go.

Forgiveness is not weakness.
It is strength.
It is courage.
It is the work of God
alive in you.

So today, let forgiveness
be your offering.
Your healing.
Your final step
on this 21‑day road.


So let us pray:  
Lord, give me the courage to forgive
as You have forgiven me.
Heal my heart,
soften my spirit,
and free me from every weight
that keeps me from love.
Amen.

Activity for today:  
Write down one name —
or one moment —
you need to forgive.
Hold it before God…
and ask for the grace
to release it.

Thank you for walking these 21 days of Lent with me.
May forgiveness free your heart,
and may God’s mercy guide your steps
into the days ahead.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
