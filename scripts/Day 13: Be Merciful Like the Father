Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.


Today is Day 13… Monday of the Second Week of Lent —
and today, Jesus gives us a simple command
that feels both beautiful and impossible:

“Be merciful,
just as your Father is merciful.”

Mercy.
Not fairness.
Not payback.
Not “giving people what they deserve.”
Mercy.

Mercy is the heart of God.
Mercy is the language of heaven.
Mercy is the way God looks at you —
with tenderness,
with patience,
with compassion,
with a love that refuses to give up on you.

But here’s the challenge:
We often struggle to give others
what God so freely gives us.

We hold onto grudges.
We replay old hurts.
We judge quickly.
We assume the worst.
We protect ourselves with walls
instead of opening ourselves with grace.

And yet Jesus says,
“Be merciful.”
Not because it’s easy,
but because it’s transformative.

Mercy doesn’t excuse wrongdoing —
it heals the wound it left behind.
Mercy doesn’t deny the pain —
it refuses to let pain have the final word.
Mercy doesn’t erase justice —
it completes it with love.

To be merciful like the Father
means learning to see people
the way God sees them.

Not as enemies.
Not as problems.
Not as disappointments.
But as souls —
fragile, wounded, beloved souls
who are also trying to find their way.

Maybe there’s someone in your life
who needs mercy from you today.
Someone who hurt you.
Someone who misunderstood you.
Someone who failed you.
Someone who didn’t show up
in the way you hoped they would.

Mercy doesn’t mean pretending it didn’t hurt.
It means choosing compassion
over resentment.
It means choosing understanding
over judgment.
It means choosing love
over bitterness.

And here’s the beautiful truth:
When you show mercy,
you become more like God.
You reflect His heart.
You carry His light.
You participate in His healing work
in the world.

Mercy is not weakness.
Mercy is strength —
the kind of strength that comes from heaven.

So today, let mercy soften you.
Let it open you.
Let it shape you.
Let it make you more like the Father
who has been merciful to you
again and again and again.


So let us pray:  
Father, make my heart like Yours.
Teach me to be merciful,
patient,
and compassionate.
Help me love others
with the same mercy You show me.
Amen.

Activity for today:  
Choose one person
and offer them mercy —
a gentle word,
a softened judgment,
a small act of compassion.
Let mercy be your gift today.


Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May the mercy of the Father
shape your heart
and guide your steps.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
