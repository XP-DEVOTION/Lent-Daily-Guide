Peace be with you.
Welcome back to this Lenten journey —
a slow, honest walk toward the heart of God.
Wherever you are right now,
take a breath…
let your spirit settle…
and let’s step into today together.


Today is Day 14… Tuesday of the Second Week of Lent —
and today, Jesus invites us into a virtue
that is often misunderstood,
often resisted,
and yet absolutely essential
for a heart that wants to grow:

Humility.

Jesus says,
“Whoever exalts himself will be humbled,
and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”

Humility is not weakness.
It’s not self‑hatred.
It’s not shrinking yourself
or pretending you’re less than you are.

Humility is truth.
Humility is clarity.
Humility is seeing yourself
the way God sees you —
no more,
no less.

It’s recognizing your strengths
without pride.
It’s acknowledging your limits
without shame.
It’s knowing you are loved
without needing to prove yourself.

But humility is hard
because we live in a world
that rewards performance,
celebrates image,
and pressures us to appear strong,
confident,
successful,
in control.

And yet Jesus calls us
to something quieter,
something deeper,
something freer.

Humility is the posture
that makes room for God.

When you stop trying to hold everything together,
God can hold you.
When you stop pretending you have all the answers,
God can guide you.
When you stop trying to be impressive,
God can be present.

Humility is not about lowering yourself —
it’s about lifting your eyes.

It’s about remembering
that you don’t have to be perfect
to be loved.
You don’t have to be strong
to be held.
You don’t have to be extraordinary
to be chosen.

Maybe there’s an area of your life
where you’ve been trying too hard
to prove something —
to yourself,
to others,
to God.

Maybe you’ve been carrying the weight
of expectations,
comparison,
or fear of failure.

Humility invites you
to lay that weight down.

To say,
“Lord, I need You.”
To admit your limits
without losing your dignity.
To trust that God lifts the humble
not because they are small,
but because they are open.

Humility is the soil
where grace grows.

It softens the heart.
It clears the mind.
It opens the soul
to receive what God has been waiting to give.

So today, let humility be your prayer.
Let it be your posture.
Let it be your freedom.

Not a burden.
Not a punishment.
But a doorway
into deeper love.


So let us pray:  
Jesus, give me a humble heart.
Help me let go of pride,
fear,
and the need to prove myself.
Teach me to rest in Your love
and trust Your strength.
Amen.

Activity for today:  
Do one small act of humility —
apologize,
ask for help,
or let someone else go first.
Let it soften your heart
and open you to grace.


Thank you for walking this day of Lent with me.
May humility open your heart
to the gentle work of God.
And until we meet again —
peace be with you.
